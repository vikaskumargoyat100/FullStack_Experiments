Project Overview
A Node.js and Express.js based ticket booking system that implements concurrent seat reservation with locking mechanism to prevent race conditions. This system simulates real-world booking scenarios similar to platforms like BookMyShow or Ticketmaster.

Technical Architecture
Core Components
Express.js Server: RESTful API framework

In-Memory Storage: Volatile data persistence using JavaScript arrays and Map

Concurrency Control: Seat locking mechanism with timeout

Automatic Cleanup: Periodic expiration of stale locksProject Overview
